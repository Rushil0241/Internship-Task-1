IP Addresses 

1) 10.0.2.2

135/tcp  open  msrpc 
Vulnerable to buffer overflow and DoS attacks if unpatched.
Exploited in the past (e.g., Blaster worm, CVE-2003-0352).
Can be used in information gathering (e.genumerating services or users)

445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
Extremely high-risk if exposed to the internet.
Target of many exploits, including:
EternalBlue (used in WannaCry ransomware)
SMBRelay, SMBGhost (CVE-2020-0796)
Can leak sensitive information (hostnames, shares, users).
Vulnerable to MITM attacks and remote code execution if misconfigured.


9010/tcp open  sdr
This is not a well-known standardized port.Unknown services on uncommon ports are often a red flag.
Could allow remote access or be a backdoor.
May expose APIs or control interfaces without authentication.

2) 10.0.2.3

53/tcp open  domain
Port 53 is used for DNS (Domain Name System).
Typically runs over UDP for standard queries.
Here are the common risks if TCP 53 is open to untrusted networks:
DNS Zone Transfers – Can leak internal domain/host info if not restricted.
DDoS Amplification Attacks – Misconfigured DNS can be used in reflection attacks.
Information Disclosure – May expose internal IPs, hostnames, or server version.
DNS Cache Poisoning – Attackers could inject fake DNS records.
DNS Tunneling – Attackers can exfiltrate data or run C2 channels via DNS.
Unintended DNS Exposure – Server might be unintentionally accessible to the internet.
Service Misuse – Unauthorized users might exploit it for unauthorized queries or attacks.



3) 10.0.2.15
All 1000 scanned ports on 10.0.2.15 are in ignored states.



No common service were found running on those ports.
